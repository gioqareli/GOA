        <p class="p1">Global warming is the process of gradual increase in the average annual temperature of the earth's surface, atmosphere and ocean. It represents the long-term increase in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system, expressed by direct temperature measurements and indicators of various warming effects.[4] This is a major aspect of climate change, which, in addition to increasing global surface temperatures,[5] also includes consequences such as changes in atmospheric precipitation.[6] Although there have been prehistoric periods of global warming,[7] the observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented in speed and magnitude.[8]

            The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that "human influence on the climate has been the dominant factor in climate warming since the mid-20th century".[9] These research results are recognized by the scientific academies of many countries and are not disputed by any national or international scientific body.[10] Humans have a large impact on greenhouse gas emissions, with more than 90% of the impact coming from carbon dioxide and methane.[11] Fossil fuel combustion is a major source of these gases, with agricultural emissions and deforestation also playing an important role.[12] Climate sensitivity to these gases has been linked to feedbacks such as loss of snow cover, increased water vapor, and thawing of fertile soils.[13]
            
            Land surfaces are warming faster than ocean surfaces,[1] resulting in heat waves, wildfires, and expanding deserts.[14] Increasing atmospheric forcing and evaporation rates are causing more intense storms and extreme weather, damaging infrastructure and agriculture.[15] The rise in surface temperatures is greatest in the Arctic and affects glacier retreat, permafrost and sea ice.[16] Environmental impacts have resulted in the extirpation or migration of many species due to ecosystem change directly on coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic.[17] Land surface temperatures would stabilize and fall slightly if emissions were reduced, but other impacts would last for centuries, including sea-level rise from melting ice sheets, rising ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification from high levels of carbon dioxide.[18][19]
            
            Mitigation efforts to address global warming include the development and readiness of low-carbon energy technologies, policies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, afforestation, forest protection, as well as increasing the potential of climate engineering technologies. Communities and governments are working on current and future adaptation to the impacts of global warming, which includes improving coastal protection, better disaster management, and developing resilient cultures.
            
            Countries work together on climate change under the umbrella of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which has near-universal membership. The purpose of the convention is to "prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system".[20] The IPCC emphasized the need to keep global warming below 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) relative to pre-industrial levels to avoid irreversible consequences.[21] With current policies and pledges, global warming is expected to reach 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century.[22] Given current greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels, the emissions budget will be exhausted by 2028 under conditions of staying below 1.5 °C (2.7 °F).[23]</p>
